# Snake-Project
Iconic Snake game remade in python for COP final project, or rather our take on the iconic snake game made in python.


For our project we decided to try and recreate the iconic snake game we all know and love through Python. By using online resources to decide what the best way to go about recreating the game and whether there we already existing tools we could use to help our desired vision, we eventually stumbled upon Pygame, which is a python package that contains various rendering functions and event handlings that are perfectly designed for a video game type creation through Python. Using simple event key functions while interacting with rendering objects, the player uses the arrow keys to control the snake in 4 different directions (Up, Down, Left, and Right) in order to move the snake into fruit that is randomly generated throughout the boundaries. Once the snake eats the fruit, itâ€™s length grows by one but be CAREFUL, if the snake hits any of the wall boundaries or itself, the snake will crash, and the game will be over! Good players will be rewarded with their score being displayed on a local leaderboard. Good luck and may the best players win!
