# Snake-Project
Iconic Snake game remade in python for COP final project, or rather our take on the iconic snake game made in python.


  For our project we decided to remake the iconic snake game that we all know and love, while putting our own twist on it. Admittedly, we did have some trouble coding the game, whether it was because of runtime errors, syntax errors, or the game simply not popping up when we wanted it to, hence we decided to go online and look at how other people approached recreating the game. We did however put our own unique twist on the game. Once we finished coding however, we realized that the game really wasn't challenging, so we decided to add  a mode to spice things up a little. In this mode, everytime the snake ate a fruit, it would become faster, until it would eventually become quite the hassle to control. We also wanted to include a local leader board, so that whenever you play the game, you could compete against our scores, or some of your previous oneâ€™s. Furthermore, we also added a couple of customization options, like changing the background, or the design of your snake. All in all, we hope yall will enjoy playing the game.
