# Snake-Project
Iconic Snake game remade in python for COP final project, or rather our take on the iconic snake game made in python.

For our project, we decided to remake the code for the iconic snake game that we all know and love. We did have some trouble with coding the game, whether it was because of run time errors, getting the game to pop up when we wanted to run the game, and more. We did decide to go online and look and multiples codes for the game to try and get started up and to get some inspiration on how to make the game run and how we can put own little twist on the game. When we first got the coding done and we tried running it, it did work, but we felt like the game wasn't really chanlenging. So we decided to make it so everytime you ate one of the fruit, it would speed the snake up by one frame per second. We also tried to give the game its own background to make it feel like it was our game and not just every other snake game you can find online. We even put a scoreboard on our game to let the person playing the game know what score they are at so that they can feel accomplished and proud of themselves when they complete the game. We will know deminstrate how the game works by us three playing the game right now.
